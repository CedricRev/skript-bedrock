## skript-bedrock

This is a simple recompilation of Skcrew's floodgate module to support latest version of Skript. Since the original author suddenly vanished and abandoned the project, I copied every floodgate module from it and rebuilt it for a client of mine who wanted to add support for Bedrock players through Geyser. All credits goes to the Skcrew author.

#### What's changed?
1. Updated to support Skript 2.10.0+.
2. Updated to support later versions of Floodgate 2.0.
3. Form buttons with images can now fetch from texture packs.

Although the addon is pretty basic, I am planning to include the new features from floodgate to in here when I have time.
